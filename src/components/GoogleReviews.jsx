                    <p className="text-[0.75rem]">Car was covered in severe hail damage, some dents so deep it would make you wince. The car came out looking brand new, not a single problem, I was actually lost for words when I saw it. Bill is a magician and not to mention the affordability and speed of his work, all done in a single day. Could not recommend his services and professionalism enough!</p>

                    <p className="text-[0.75rem]">Got a scratch or dent - do yourself a favour and see Bill. He is the best! If youâ€™re not near the city, make the trip. Totes worth it.Honest, reliable, fast service and so lovely to deal with, without the BS that you might get from somewhere else. He really takes the time and care to get the job done right, in the time he quotes.</p>

                    <p className="text-[0.75rem]">I took my Alfa for Bill to have a look at the dent. Previous quotes I received ranged from $350 -$ 900. Bill fixed the dent seamlessly for the price of $200. Furthermore, I dropped the car off in the morning and it was completed by 4:30 pm the same day. All other places wanted me to leave the car over two days. I would recommend Bill's service to everyone.</p>

                    <p className="text-[0.75rem]">I went to Bill in Dentfix and gave me a good quote (huge difference compared to the others) and since it has good reviews I gave it a try. I dropped the car Thursday and it was ready the next day. It came out perfect, clean and smooth (Bill also fixed some minor dents without charge).</p>
