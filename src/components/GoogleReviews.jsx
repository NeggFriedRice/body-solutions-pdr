                    <p className={sliderTextStyle}>Matt did an amazing job fixing a tricky dent. He was open and honest about the process including risk of paint damage. I'm very happy with the results and the mark is virtually invisible now. Hopefully I won't need his services again but I wouldn't hesitate to do so or recommend him. Very friendly, professional and great result!</p>

Not only that, Matt was so kind to swap around his work to suit our timing. Highly recommended for anyone looking to get the paint-less dent repair for the car. Thank you so much for the great help Matt! Glad to find u!</p>

                    <p className={sliderTextStyle}>Matt is an awesome bloke as well as a magician when it comes to paintless dent removal. I had about 15 annoying little dents on my aluminium bodied car and none of them were easily accessible spots to get to. Initially I was hoping to have some of them improved but he managed to make them all disappear. His experience shows and his pricing seems cheap for what he can do.</p>

Patience, friendly, passion and the end result is just top notch. Highly recommended. Will be passing Matt details to all my friends that seeking dent repair professional. Thanks again Matt.</p>

Matt was even good enough to spot a few small dents around the main ones that I hadn't noticed and gave them some attention too. An all round great bloke producing high end results at a very reasonable price.</p>
